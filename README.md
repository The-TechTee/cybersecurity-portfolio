# About Me
Name: Tamika Moore

Hometown: Gary Indiana/USA

Prior IT Expereince:
I am kind of new to the industry. I was a Customer Tech Agent for Conduent & ConCentrix, both on the Apple contract. I was responsible for inbound and outbound correspondance, as well as helping with resetting passwords, passcodes or accounts. I also help in transfer of data from one mobile device to another or from PC to Mac. 

Career Plans: I am somewhat undecided at this time. I have been doing reasearch on cybersecurity analyst, Engineer, Penetration tester , incident responder, as well as cloud security. However, I would like to learn all that I can, in order to make a more informed decision.
